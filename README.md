# Text encryption/decryption 

This repo contains a simple text encryption algorithm that can be used for things that don't need to be incredibly secure but still don't want to be

readable to the average person. This algorithm changes the letters in the string given by the user to a encrypted text using a custom cypher that is not as

easily cracked as a cesar cypher.

## Navigation

There are different folders listed as the versions of the algorithm.

You can find the version that works best for you or use the newest version.

## Usage

Either download the files or copy and paste the code

into your text editor and adapt it into your program.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
