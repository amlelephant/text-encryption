# Text encryption/decryption 

This repo contains a simple text encryption algorithm that can be used for things that don't need to be incredibly secure but still don't want to be

readable to the average person. This algorithm changes the letters in the string given by the user to a encrypted text using a custom cypher that is not as

easily cracked as a cesar cypher. (Previous text is for v1-2) V3 uses an xor encryption algorithim for secure encryption/decrption. I implemented a system inside of it to 
check if the pad is the correct one and then procede to encrypt/decrypt the text. (Note that XOR algorithim is not fully built out so pick bits and pieces for what is necessary
for your project)

## Navigation

There are different folders listed as the versions of the algorithm.

You can find the version that works best for you or use the newest version.

## Usage

Either download the files or copy and paste the code

into your text editor and adapt it into your program.

## Contributing
